# Repositorio base del Curso de Introducción a React.js en Platzi

 # TODO APP
TODO APP is a web development project based on React JS, created in conjunction with the React.js Course by Platzi.

It allows users to create tasks with the functionality to mark them as completed and delete them. It also includes a counter that indicates the total number of tasks and the total number of completed tasks.

# Hooks Used in the Course
useState
useContext
useEffect
customHooks
createPortal

My Personal Touch
In learning this course, I added some of my previous experience as a Frontend developer, which I list below:

More projects are coming on ...

# Installation

# All began 

To start a React project from scratch, you can follow these steps:
Set Up the Development Environment: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website and install the LTS version.

Create a New Folder for Your Project: Open a terminal and create a new folder where you want to store your React project.

Initialize a New npm Project: In the terminal, navigate to your project folder and run the following command to initialize a new npm project:

sh
Copiar código 
npm init -y
This will create a package.json file in your project folder containing the project configuration and dependencies.

Install React and React-DOM: In the terminal, within your project folder, run the following command to install React and React-DOM as your project dependencies:

sh
Copiar código
npm install react react-dom
Set Up the Entry Point of Your Application: Create an index.html file at the root of your project folder and add the following basic HTML code:


## Example HTML Code

To set up the entry point of your React application, you can use the following HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

This file will be the entry point of your React application and will serve as the container for the content generated by React.

Create the Main File of Your Application: Create an index.js file at the root of your project folder and add the following code:

## Example React Code

To render a simple "Hello, React!" message, you can use the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h2>Hello, React!</h2>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

This file is the starting point of your React application and uses React-DOM to render a simple React component into the element with the ID root defined in the index.html file.

Configure Bundling and Compilation: To bundle and compile your React application, you can use tools like Webpack or Create React App. These tools allow you to write your code in multiple files and generate a single JavaScript file that can be included in your index.html file. You can find detailed documentation and examples on how to set up these tools in their respective documentations.

Run Your Application: Once your project is set up and bundled, you can run it in your browser. Open the index.html file in your browser and you should see the message "Hello, React!" rendered on the page.

These are the basic steps to start a React project from scratch. From here, you can continue building and developing your React application by adding components, styles, interactions, and more.






## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
